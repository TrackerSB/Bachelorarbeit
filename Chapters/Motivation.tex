\chapter{Motivation}
\draftnote{
    As the number of cores of processors, the variety of devices and platforms is increasing there is a need for an efficient compiler infrastructure which is capable of performing language and platform independent optimizations for being able to utilize the capacity of the underlying hardware.
    So projects like LLVM and Polly were developed for dealing with it.
    But there is the need of checking whether the impact of the optimzations could be bigger referencing the sizes of the areas automatically optimizable by Polly.
