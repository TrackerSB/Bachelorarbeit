\chapter{Motivation}
As the number of cores of processors and the variety of devices and platforms is increasing there is a need for an efficient compiler infrastructure which is capable of performing language and platform independent optimizations allowing to utilize the capacity of the underlying hardware as much as possible.
A popular approach of such a compiler infrastructure is LLVM.
And one of its plugins is Polly which is able to apply optimizations in the polyhedral model.
When using Polly there arises the question about the ratio of the parts which can currently be automatically optimized by Polly and what are the common reasons of these parts for not being even bigger.\\
Answering this question gives on the one hand an assessement to whether Polly is already able to optimize a high percentage of given programs -- commonly used and installed -- and on the other hand a potential to investigate the main reasons for the automatically optimizable parts not being as big as expected and the possible impact of eliminating at least some of these reasons.
