\chapter{Motivation}
\draftnote{
    As the number of cores of processors, the variety of devices and platforms is increasing there is a need for an efficient compiler infrastructure which is capable of performing language and platform independent optimizations for being able to utilize the capacity of the underlying hardware.
    So projects like LLVM and Polly were created for dealing with it.
    In this context this document is investigating the following questions:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item How big is the ratio of areas in which Polly is already able to apply its optimizations?
        \item What are the common reasons for not optimizing other/bigger areas?
        \item What can be done/What informations are needed to extend these areas?
    \end{enumerate}
}
